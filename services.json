Home-Start offers a unique service by recruiting and training volunteers who are usually parents themselves to visit families at home who have at least one child under 5 and offer them informal, friendly and confidential support. To help give children the best possible start in life, Home-Start supports parents as they grow in confidence, strengthen their relationship with their children and widen their links with the local community.\n\nWould you like to be a volunteer? Do you remember what it was like when your children were little? Sleepless Nights, Teething, Tantrums or the Terrible 2's?\n\nMany families need a friend. They are coping with impossible pressures due to a variety of reasons including divorce, loneliness, isolation and illness. Sometimes it helps just to have someone there to listen. Someone who understands just what it's like.\n\nThe work of a Home-Start volunteer can be challenging  but it is also rewarding, interesting and varied. Volunteers have \"been there\" and they can use their life experience to help others. Everyone has something to offer regardless of age, experience or background.

Every year we win the  trust and commitment of over 3,700 young people that most other organisations find it difficult to engage. Outside education, training and employment, they have often lost hope for their future.  We help them to think differently. Using a unique a combination of long-term personal support and challenging activities, we enable young people to build a sense of self worth and develop the personal, social and life skills they need to enjoy a future full of choice and opportunity. The Fairbridge U16 and 16+ programmes provide personal development for young people aged 13-25 who struggle with personal and social skills, lack confidence and motivation, and who may not be engaging effectively in statutory provision, such as education, employment or training. The primary area of focus for the U16 and 16+ programmes is the development of personal and social skills.

I live in Normanby with my husband and three children, between the ages of 18 and 8.

Perfect for little ones to play safely.\n\nMY SKILLS\n - prior to becoming a childminder I have worked for a number of local authorities but decided I wanted to have a more rewarding career.  I love being around children of all ages and often marvel at the simple pleasures that can spark a child's imagination.  It's wonderful to see them grow and develop within your care setting.  Most of my experience comes from being a mother of two of my own children (18 and 16) and my stepson (8).\nA typical day in my setting may involve visiting the library, dancing and singing, reading and listening to stories and even a game of dress up to act out what we have just read.  Children of all ages can get involved with and enjoy doing crafts.  From finger or sponge painting to play doh modelling, looking after their own flowers or veggies in the garden.  Older children may like to hep cook a simple and healthy lunch.  Weather permitting we take regular trips to local parks and woodlands and have plenty of educational toys and games to entertain at home.  I believe in having a routine, but also have enough flexibility to be child led.\n\nQUALIFICATIONS:\nChildcare Home Practitioner - Apr 12\nPaediatric First Aid - Apr 12\nFood Hygiene - Apr 12\nSafeguarding Children - Mar 12\nSafeguarding Children & Internet security - Mar 12\nEYFS Update Training - Jul 12\n18 Years Parenting Experience\nMasters Degree (not childcare)\n\nFor more information and vacancies please contact Families' Information Service.","keyFeature1":"","keyFeature2":"","keyFeature3":"","keyFeature4":"","keyFeature5":"","keyFeature6":"","kiteMarks":"","contactName":"Families' Information Service","contactJobTitle":"","contactTel":"0800 073 8800","contactEmail":"","accessDetails":"","referralOnly":"","referralOnlyDetails":"","appointmentOnly":"","appointmentOnlyDetails":"","dropIn":"","dropInDetails":"","genderTarget":"","genderTargetType":"Male","ageTarget":"Yes","ageTargetType":"Range","age1":"0","age1Months":"","age2":"11","age2Months":"","geographicRestriction":"","geographicCoverage":"","id":"C916E7D4C057D34480257A64004D28CE","servicePeriodsOld":"Monday to Sunday 6.00am - 6.00pm","contacts":[{"type":"Telephone","details":"Families' Information Service - 0800 073 8800","description":""}],"servicePeriods":[],"costs":[{"type":"Service Cost","details":"Costs discussed with parent\/carer"}],"venues":[],"downloads":[],"isStub":false,"href":"/pin.nsf/page?readform&release=no#id=c916e7d4c057d34480257a64004d28ce"},{"category1":["Health","Learning and Training"],"category2":"","tags":"In School & Educational Support Services;Counselling & Therapy","accreditation":"CRB","orgName":"Redcar and Cleveland Council","serviceName":"Psychological Service: Educational Psychology and Counselling","description":"Psychology Services for children, families, schools and other settings.\n\nWe offer:\n\nConsultation and advice\nAssessment\nIntervention\nTraining\nProject work or small scale research\nWe provide direct counselling services to children and families\nWe also provide supervision for other professionals working with children.\n\nMuch of our work is around the area of special educational needs though we have a more general role in relation to concerns around the psychological development and well being of children and young people.\n\nOur specialist areas include the effects of:\n\nThinking and learning difficulties;\nCommunication and interaction difficulties;\nBehavioural emotional and social difficulties; Physical and sensory difficulties;\nEarly Years and autistic spectrum conditions;\nThe needs of children looked after by the Local Authority.","keyFeature1":"Behavioural emotional and social difficulties; Physical and sensory difficulties;","keyFeature2":"Counselling","keyFeature3":"Thinking and Learning Difficulties","keyFeature4":"Intervention","keyFeature5":"Early Years and autistic spectrum conditions;","keyFeature6":"Supervision","kiteMarks":"","contactName":"Sarah Volkmann\/Alison Lewis","contactJobTitle":"","contactTel":"01642 286644 \/ 837700","contactEmail":"Psychologicalservice1@redcar-cleveland.gov.uk","accessDetails":"","referralOnly":"Yes","referralOnlyDetails":"Request for educational psychologist involvement is usually arranged through the school SEN Co-ordinator (SENCO).

Once you are on the Electoral Register you will be sent pollcards when any elections are taking place. You can choose not to vote if you don't want to. You may also wish to apply to vote by post if this is more convenient to you. you will need to complete an application form and supply your date of birth and signature on the application form.

One little known fact is that up to 18%  (1 in 6) of men suffer some form of abuse at the hands of their partners during their lifetime.\n \nAnother popular misconception, is that domestic abuse consists solely of violence towards a partner, however domestic abuse has many varied facets, which can include: being continually humiliated, criticised, and shouted at by your partner, constant fear of your partner, partner controls everything, the feeling of helplessness in the relationship, ill treatment which you're embarrassed to disclose to your friends\/family, the with-holding finances \/ money, also sexual abuse including using and with-holding sex as a form of punishment.\n\nWe are finding that more men are now finding the strength to come forward and ask for support after suffering domestic abuse from either a female or male partner, which is why we are now offering a male support group in the Teesside area.\n\n<b>The male support group will provide counselling, one to one support and group support. There is no shame in asking for help and support, and no-one should suffer from domestic abuse.

The ISVA will also arrange pre trial visits to court, explain the judicial process and support the victim and any family members when you give evidence incourt.\nThe ISVA can offer regular emotional and practical support and help the victim deal with any of the effects from the rape, sexual assault or childhood sexual abuse.\n\nSanctuary Scheme\nAt times it can feel that the only solution to domestic abuse is to continually move which can mean moving away from family and other support networks.  The aim of the Sanctuary Scheme is to make it possible for victims and potential victims of domestic violence to remain in their home and feel safe. This entails the provision and installation of security measures to a resident's home which will in turn deter the perpetrator from any repeat incidents and allow the resident to feel safer in their home.  Anyone fitting the criteria can be considered for the scheme regardless of who you rent your home from but we will need permission from the landlord\/owner to carry out the work.  We will make arrangements with the Crime Reduction Officer (CRO) to carry out a property survey and risk assessment. \nTemporary refuge accommodation can be arranged through Foundation UK for clients who still feel threatened and are at risk of further violence whilst they are waiting for an assessment and for the agreed measures to be installed.\n\nChildren & Young People Service\nThe overall aim of the service is to provide therapeutic support to children and young people affected by domestic violence.  An integral element of the support will include reducing further risk and safeguarding.  This will be done by providing Assessment of need, individual support, group support, safety planning, advocacy, social and recreational activity and preventative workshops.  We have listened to children and young people and this is what they say they want from our service:\n- To have someone who understands to talk to\n - To learn how to stay safe\n- To meet other children and young people who have had similar experiences\n- To be in control of the support they are offered\n\nFreedom Programme\nThe Freedom programme is a 12 week rolling programme.  This means you can join at any point, the benefits are the same so long as you complete the whole 12 weeks.\nWho is it for: The programme is for women who have experienced domestic abuse in the past and for women who are presently in an abusive relationship.\nThe aims: \n- To help women understand the beliefs held by perpetrators and in doing so recognise which of those beliefs they have shared\n- To illustrate the effects of domestic abuse on children\n- To assist women to recognise potential future abusers\n- To help women gain self-esteem and the confidence to improve the quality of their lives.\n","keyFeature1":"Independent Domestic Violence Advocate","keyFeature2":"Independent Sexual Violence Advocate","keyFeature3":"Children & Young People's Service: therapeutic support .","keyFeature4":"Sanctuary Scheme","keyFeature5":"Refuge","keyFeature6":"Web Site: www.foundationdomesticabuse.org","kiteMarks":"","contactName":"Rebecca Mount","contactJobTitle":"Administrator","contactTel":"03004562214","contactEmail":"rebecca.mount@foundationuk.ory","accessDetails":"Refuge accommodation is for women only, boys up to the age of 18.","referralOnly":"","referralOnlyDetails":"","appointmentOnly":"","appointmentOnlyDetails":"","dropIn":"","dropInDetails":"","genderTarget":"Yes","genderTargetType":"Female","ageTarget":"","ageTargetType":"Above","age1":"","age1Months":"","age2":"","age2Months":"","geographicRestriction":"","geographicCoverage":"","id":"B22AE87E3038A86880257AD7004075E1","contacts":[{"type":"Telephone","details":"03004562214","description":"Main Line"}],"servicePeriods":[{"day":["Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri"],"hours1":"08:00:00","hours2":"18:00:00","description":"Saturday & Sunday 10am to 2pm."}],"costs":[],"venues":[{"venueId":"DE3229B336BEE39963737ADCCBB2548D","description":""},{"venueId":"4C2818B8C855A6B180257B3500472133","description":""}],"downloads":[],"isStub":false,"href":"/pin.nsf/page?readform&release=no#id=b22ae87e3038a86880257ad7004075e1"},{"category1":["Health","Home and Family"],"category2":"","tags":"Mental Health Services;Counselling & Therapy;Families & Parenting","accreditation":["Adult safeguarding policy","Child protection Policy","CQC","CRB","Qualified first aider"],"orgName":"Tees, Esk & Wear Valley's NHS Foundation Trust","serviceName":"Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS)","description":"We are an NHS assessment and therapeutic service for referred children and young people (up to their 18th birthday) and their families. <\/p><p>The service offers assessment and\/or treatment for children and young people suffering from emotional, behavioural, relationship and developmental difficulties which have a big impact on their lives and require specialist intervention.
