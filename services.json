Home-Start \noffers a unique service by recruiting and training volunteers who are usually \nparents themselves to visit families at home who have at least one child under \n5 and offer them informal, friendly and confidential support. To help give \nchildren the best possible start in life, Home-Start supports parents as they \ngrow in confidence, strengthen their relationship with their children and widen \ntheir links with the local community.\n\nWould you like to be a volunteer? Do you remember what it was like when your \nchildren were little? Sleepless Nights, Teething, Tantrums or the Terrible 2's?\n\nMany families need a friend. They are coping with impossible pressures due to a \nvariety of reasons including divorce, loneliness, isolation and illness. \nSometimes it helps just to have someone there to listen. Someone who \nunderstands just what it's like.\n\nThe work of a Home-Start volunteer can be challenging  but it is also \nrewarding, interesting and varied.

A place where you can safely leave your child and know their welfare is paramount.<\/p>","keyFeature1":"","keyFeature2":"","keyFeature3":"","keyFeature4":"","keyFeature5":"","keyFeature6":"","kiteMarks":"","contactName":"Families' Information Service","contactJobTitle":"","contactTel":"0800 073 8800","contactEmail":"","accessDetails":"Children only","referralOnly":"","referralOnlyDetails":"","appointmentOnly":"Yes","appointmentOnlyDetails":"Telephone the Families' Information Service for further information.","dropIn":"","dropInDetails":"","genderTarget":"","genderTargetType":"Male","ageTarget":"Yes","ageTargetType":"Above","age1":"0","age1Months":"3","age2":"11","age2Months":"","geographicRestriction":"Yes","geographicCoverage":"Ormesby","id":"A7C5C091A7F7CB76802574B2002A8E55","contacts":[],"servicePeriods":[],"costs":[],"venues":[],"isStub":false,"href":"/pin.nsf/page?readform&release=no#id=a7c5c091a7f7cb76802574b2002a8e55"},{"category1":"Learning and Training","category2":"","tags":"Childminders","accreditation":"CRB","orgName":"Childminder - Maureen Smith","serviceName":"","description":"Maureen offers care afternoons, part time, weekdays, full term, term times, \nschool holidays, early mornings and day time.\n\nOffer school pickup\/drop off  to Galley Hill Primary and St Paulinus RC Primary \nSchool.\n\nFor more information please contact the Families' Information Service.","keyFeature1":"","keyFeature2":"","keyFeature3":"","keyFeature4":"","keyFeature5":"","keyFeature6":"","kiteMarks":"","contactName":"Families' Information Service","contactJobTitle":"","contactTel":"0800 073 8800","contactEmail":"","accessDetails":"Children only","referralOnly":"","referralOnlyDetails":"","appointmentOnly":"Yes","appointmentOnlyDetails":"Telephone the Families' Information Service for further information.","dropIn":"","dropInDetails":"","genderTarget":"","genderTargetType":"Male","ageTarget":"Yes","ageTargetType":"Above","age1":"0","age1Months":"3","age2":"14","age2Months":"","geographicRestriction":"Yes","geographicCoverage":"Guisborough","id":"311A2C91AAB82F55802574B2002B75FC","contacts":[],"servicePeriods":[],"costs":[],"venues":[],"isStub":false,"href":"/pin.nsf/page?readform&release=no#id=311a2c91aab82f55802574b2002b75fc"},{"category1":"Leisure and Sport","category2":"Leisure and Sport","tags":["Sports;Fitness;Clubs","Hobbies & Interests;Dancing"],"accreditation":"","orgName":"J9 Dance","serviceName":"","description":"Dance classes in ballet, tap, modern\/jazz, cheerleading and street dance for \nchildren from 3 years of age.

They are \nmore likely to have no qualifications or low basic skills, or be unemployed or \nhomeless.\n<p><b>Young offenders and ex-offenders<\/b><\/p>\nAccording to a Home Office survey, 3.95% of the 16-25 population have offended.\nThe Prince's Trust does not run programmes exclusively for young offenders and \nex-offenders, but we recognise the strength of our programmes to help them \nbreak the offending cycle and fulfil their aspirations.","keyFeature1":"","keyFeature2":"","keyFeature3":"","keyFeature4":"","keyFeature5":"","keyFeature6":"","kiteMarks":"","contactName":"Daisy Kendall","contactJobTitle":"","contactTel":"National Tel:   020 7543 1234  North East (Middlesbrough)  01642 201000","contactEmail":"jane.kendall@princes-trust.org.uk","accessDetails":"","referralOnly":"","referralOnlyDetails":"","appointmentOnly":"","appointmentOnlyDetails":"","dropIn":"","dropInDetails":"","genderTarget":"","genderTargetType":"Male","ageTarget":"","ageTargetType":"Above","age1":"","age1Months":"","age2":"","age2Months":"","geographicRestriction":"","geographicCoverage":"","id":"B7DB536500C6E59180257665005481B9","contacts":[{"type":"Website","details":"www.princes-trust.org.uk","description":""}],"servicePeriods":[],"costs":[],"venues":[{"venueId":"5105C9FD7FF5042980257A84003690E4","description":""}],"isStub":false,"href":"/pin.nsf/page?readform&release=no#id=b7db536500c6e59180257665005481b9"},{"category1":"Learning and Training","category2":"","tags":"Childminders","accreditation":"CRB","orgName":"Childminder - Jackie Evans","serviceName":"","description":"Jackie offers childcare all year, full term, half term, early mornings, \nbefore\/after school, afternoons, weekends, part-time, school holidays, evening \nand emergency.

Anyone over the Age of 16 who is British or a qualifying Commonwealth Citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland or other EU member state, can be registered to vote, although they can not vote until they are 18. You do not have to vote, but being registered to vote gives you that choice. There are 2 versions of the Electoral Register and if you do not wish to be included in the version that is available to anyone to buy, then you need to tell us that you wish to 'Opt Out' of this Edited Version.

This can be physical, emotional, sexual, financial or psychological.\n\nServices\n\nRefuge\n The refuge provides safe and secure refuge accommodation to women and children who are fleeing domestic abuse.   Our refuge is purpose built with 12 flats ranging from 1 to 3 bedrooms.  The flats are self contained with a kitchen, lounge, bedrooms and bathroom fully furnished to a high standard.  Within the refuge we also have a training\/meeting room, communal kitchen, communal lounge, laundry and children's area.\nWhilst living in the refuge customers will be allocated a key worker who can offer assistance with attending meetings, legal support such as attending courts and solicitors, housing, benefits, support with secondary needs such as substance misuse, health, money management, access to counselling and such.\n\nIndependent Domestic Violence Advocate (IDVA)\nThe IDVA can help and support victims of domestic abuse who are accessing or thinking of accessing the criminal justice system.  They can liaise between the police and court services to ensure that the victim's voice is heard.  The IDVA works closely with the witness service which allows court visits giving the victim the opportunity to look around the courtroom prior to any criminal trial and discuss any queries the victim may have.  The IDVA can also offer emotional and practical support to fit in with your needs.  They can help you to explore your options and provide information to enable you to make the best choices for you and your family.\n\nIndependent Sexual Abuse Advocate (ISVA)\nThe ISVA can help and support victims of sexual abuse who are accessing or thinking of accessing the criminal justice system.  The ISVA will liaise with relevant agencies on behalf of the victim and will ensues their requirements as witnesses are provided for if the case goes to court. The ISVA will also arrange pre trial visits to court, explain the judicial process and support the victim and any family members when you give evidence incourt.\nThe ISVA can offer regular emotional and practical support and help the victim deal with any of the effects from the rape, sexual assault or childhood sexual abuse.\n\nSanctuary Scheme\nAt times it can feel that the only solution to domestic abuse is to continually move which can mean moving away from family and other support networks.  The aim of the Sanctuary Scheme is to make it possible for victims and potential victims of domestic violence to remain in their home and feel safe. This entails the provision and installation of security measures to a resident's home which will in turn deter the perpetrator from any repeat incidents and allow the resident to feel safer in their home.  Anyone fitting the criteria can be considered for the scheme regardless of who you rent your home from but we will need permission from the landlord\/owner to carry out the work.  We will make arrangements with the Crime Reduction Officer (CRO) to carry out a property survey and risk assessment. \nTemporary refuge accommodation can be arranged through Foundation UK for clients who still feel threatened and are at risk of further violence whilst they are waiting for an assessment and for the agreed measures to be installed.\n\nChildren & Young People Service\nThe overall aim of the service is to provide therapeutic support to children and young people affected by domestic violence.  An integral element of the support will include reducing further risk and safeguarding.  This will be done by providing Assessment of need, individual support, group support, safety planning, advocacy, social and recreational activity and preventative workshops.  We have listened to children and young people and this is what they say they want from our service:\n- To have someone who understands to talk to\n - To learn how to stay safe\n- To meet other children and young people who have had similar experiences\n- To be in control of the support they are offered\n\nFreedom Programme\nThe Freedom programme is a 12 week rolling programme.  This means you can join at any point, the benefits are the same so long as you complete the whole 12 weeks.\nWho is it for: The programme is for women who have experienced domestic abuse in the past and for women who are presently in an abusive relationship.\nThe aims: \n- To help women understand the beliefs held by perpetrators and in doing so recognise which of those beliefs they have shared\n- To illustrate the effects of domestic abuse on children\n- To assist women to recognise potential future abusers\n- To help women gain self-esteem and the confidence to improve the quality of their lives.\n","keyFeature1":"Independent Domestic Violence Advocate","keyFeature2":"Independent Sexual Violence Advocate","keyFeature3":"Children & Young People's Service: therapeutic support .","keyFeature4":"Sanctuary Scheme","keyFeature5":"Refuge","keyFeature6":"Web Site: www.foundationdomesticabuse.org","kiteMarks":"","contactName":"Rebecca Mount","contactJobTitle":"Administrator","contactTel":"03004562214","contactEmail":"rebecca.mount@foundationuk.ory","accessDetails":"Refuge accommodation is for women only, boys up to the age of 18.","referralOnly":"","referralOnlyDetails":"","appointmentOnly":"","appointmentOnlyDetails":"","dropIn":"","dropInDetails":"","genderTarget":"Yes","genderTargetType":"Female","ageTarget":"","ageTargetType":"Above","age1":"","age1Months":"","age2":"","age2Months":"","geographicRestriction":"","geographicCoverage":"","id":"B22AE87E3038A86880257AD7004075E1","contacts":[{"type":"Telephone","details":"03004562214","description":"Main Line"}],"servicePeriods":[{"day":["Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri"],"hours1":"08:00:00","hours2":"18:00:00","description":"Saturday & Sunday 10am to 2pm."}],"costs":[],"venues":[{"venueId":"DE3229B336BEE39963737ADCCBB2548D","description":""}],"isStub":false,"href":"/pin.nsf/page?readform&release=no#id=b22ae87e3038a86880257ad7004075e1"},{"category1":["Health","Home and Family"],"category2":"","tags":"Mental Health Services;Counselling & Therapy;Families & Parenting","accreditation":["Adult safeguarding policy","Child protection Policy","CQC","CRB","Qualified first aider"],"orgName":"Tees, Esk & Wear Valley's NHS Foundation Trust","serviceName":"Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS)","description":"We are an NHS assessment and therapeutic service for referred children and young people (up to their 18th birthday) and their families. <\/p><p>The service offers assessment and\/or treatment for children and young people suffering from emotional, behavioural, relationship and developmental difficulties which have a big impact on their lives and require specialist intervention.
